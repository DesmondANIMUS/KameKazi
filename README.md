*KameKazi* is a project that allows you to send secure messages.
Each message receives a completely unique ID and is encrypted, so absolutely nobody can see the message without the key, not even with access to the database. 
All messages are destroyed as soon as the receiver opens them.
The project has been written in Golang.

# Try it
